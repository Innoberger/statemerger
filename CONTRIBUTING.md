# How to contribute

Hello there! Since this is an open source project, feel free to contribute to this project.

On this page, there are some useful information about how you can contribute.


## Issues

### Opening a new issue

Got a problem? Bug? Feature idea? You can [open an issue](https://github.com/Innoberger/statemerger/issues/new).

The issue needs to be described as detailed as possible, including version of the application you experienced a problem, screenshots and so on. For new features, also add acceptance criteria and why you want this feature to be added. Only with a detailed description of the problem, bug or feature idea other people can work on your issue.

### Resolving an existing issue

You can pick an issue from the [existing ones](https://github.com/Innoberger/statemerger/issues) and work on that. Create a fork of this repository to commit your changes.


## Making changes

Create a [fork of this repository](https://github.com/Innoberger/statemerger/fork) and work on your issue.

After that, you can open a pull request from your fork into this repository's main branch. Keep in mind that the [demo website](https://statemerger.fynnarnold.de) is not automatically updated.

I need to verify and accept your pull request upon certain rules. Rules for pull requests to be accepted are:

* The pull request must address an existing open issue.
* Code with a decent code style and quality.
* Use as few new node nodules as possible.
* All tests (existing and new ones) must run green.
* New code must come with new (unit) tests in the [tests directory](src/__tests__).

It might take some time for me to review and accept your pull request.

Happy contributing!
